## 3. Architecture Overview

### Hierarchy (Standard Multi-tenancy)
The system follows a strict hierarchical access model:
1. **Platform (Super Admin)**: Global oversight across all clients.
2. **Company (Tenant Admin)**: Management of a single enterprise entity.
3. **Site (Location Admin)**: Management of specific physical buildings/sites.
4. **Site Context (Hierarchical Filtering)**: Global site selection mechanism via `SiteContext` allowing users to switch between assigned locations.
5. **Security/Host**: Daily operational roles for check-ins and hosting within a specific site context.

## 4. Database Schema & Data Models

### Enums & Domain Constants
The system utilizes strict TypeScript enums to maintain data integrity across the platform:
- **VisitorType**: `CONTRACTOR`, `INTERVIEWEE`, `VENDOR`, `GUEST`, `DELIVERY`.
- **VisitorStatus**: `ON-SITE`, `CHECKED-OUT`, `PRE-BOOKED`, `PENDING`.
- **UserRole**: `PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `COMPANY_ADMIN`, `SITE_ADMIN`, `SECURITY`, `HOST`.

### Core Entities (PostgreSQL / TypeScript Interfaces)
| Entity | Key Fields | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Companies** | `id`, `name`, `domain`, `status`, `logoUrl` | Tenant configuration and branding. |
| **Sites** | `id`, `name`, `code`, `address`, `status`, `maxOccupancy`, `operatingHours` | Physical location and infrastructure management. |
| **Users** | `id`, `fullName`, `email`, `role`, `siteId?`, `siteIds[]` | Identity and multi-site assignment management. |
| **Visitors** | `id`, `siteId`, `type`, `status`, `checkIn`, `qrToken` | Guest profiles and site-specific activity tracking. |
| **Bookings** | `id`, `siteId`, `visitorId`, `hostId`, `scheduledTime` | Pre-arrival management and site-bound QR invitations. |
| **EntryPoints** | `id`, `siteId`, `name`, `type`, `status` | Granular entry management (Gates, Receptions). |

---

## 5. User Roles & Access Control (RBAC)
The system implements a granular RBAC model:
- **Platform Admin**: Global system configuration, company onboarding, and cross-tenant billing access.
- **Company Admin**: Oversight of all sites within their enterprise domain. Can manage global company settings.
- **Site Admin**: Restricted to a specific physical site. Manages local employees and site-specific reports.
- **Security**: Operational access to the Scanner and Visitor Log for real-time check-ins/outs.
- **Host**: Employees who can receive visitors and manage their own invited guests.

---

## 6. Design System & Branding

### Brand Colors (Dephethogo Palette)
- **Primary**: `#FF8C00` (Vibrant Orange) - Used for CTAs and status highlights.
- **Deep Hunter Green**: `#032319` - Sidebar and core structural background.
- **Mint Slate**: `#F4F7F6` - Main application background for high contrast.
- **Secondary Green**: `#13604D` - Used for secondary interactive elements.

### UI Principles
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle backdrops for overlays.
- **Micro-animations**: Staggered fades for list items and smooth sidebar transitions with Framer Motion.
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 compliant colors) and focused outlines.

## 7. Functional Modules

### A. Real-time Dashboard & Analytics
- **Dynamic KPIs**: Instant tracking of daily visitor volumes, check-in status, and occupancy limits.
- **Sites Overview**: High-fidelity operational visibility section providing real-time health and traffic data for all registered locations.
- **Hierarchical Filtering**: Global site selector in the navigation bar that synchronizes all dashboard data (Stats, Logs, Charts) to the selected site context.
- **Analytics Visualization**: Interactive Recharts components representing traffic-to-site hourly and weekly trends.

### B. Intelligent QR Scanner
- **Seamless Check-ins**: A mobile-optimized scanner that processes pre-booked appointments instantly.
- **Manual Override**: Form-based visitor registration for hardware-agnostic check-ins.
- **Instant Validation**: Real-time cross-referencing against the `Bookings` and `Transactions` tables.

### C. Visitor & Site Management
- **Centralized Profiles**: Common guest information database for easy re-registration across multiple sites of the same company.
- **Audit Trails**: Every entry is timestamped and user-stamped for comprehensive site security review.

---

## 8. Security & Privacy Compliance

### User Data Isolation
- Each company's data is isolated using deep multi-tenant logic. No global querying across different `Company IDs` is allowed at the application layer.

### Identity Management
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication for all API and frontend operations.
- **Granular RBAC**: Permissions are strictly enforced based on the `UserRole` enum.

### Audit & Governance
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Every check-in/out event records `Host ID`, `Visitor ID`, `Site ID`, and exact time.
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention periods in accordance with regional data privacy laws.

## 9. Build, Deployment & Maintenance

### Workflow & Pipelines
1. `npm install`: Standard dependency resolution.
2. `npm run dev`: Hot-reloading development environment with ESLint integration.
3. `npm run build`: Production-ready bundling (Next.js SWC minification).
4. `npm run start`: High-concurrency production server execution.

### Infrastructure Readiness
- Compatible with modern cloud platforms (Vercel, AWS, Azure).
- Standardized environment variable structures (DB connection strings, JWT secrets).
